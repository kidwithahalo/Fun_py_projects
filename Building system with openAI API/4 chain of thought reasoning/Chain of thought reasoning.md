Pretty much the self explanatory part of processing replies and the delivering outputs. 

Here is a sample internal dialogue of the model for ease :
$$\text{The user is asking if the store sells TVs. Specific product category}$$
$$ \downarrow  $$
$$ \text{The user is not asking about a specific product, but about a product category (TVs)}$$
$$ \downarrow $$
$$\text{ Therefore, we cannot identify if the specific product is available or not.}$$
$$ \downarrow $$
$$ \text{Response to user} $$ 
$$ \downarrow $$
$$\text{Response to user: We apologize, but we are unable to} $$
$$\text{provide a specific answer regarding the availability of TVs.}$$
$$\text{Is there anything else we can assist you with?}$$

--- 
For our convenience, we find it easier to mask the thoughts and reply a simple dialogue for our answer. 

The codes are marked with comments as well to understand.
