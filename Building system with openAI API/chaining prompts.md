The concept of MECE is coming quite handy here as well. 
Trying to break the problem into 'Mutually Exclusive, Completely Exhaustive' (MECE) kind of tree to assign a task to a particular function or so  such that debugging gets at least a bit easier xD

Also, in case external too is necessary (web search, database, etc.), it becomes easier when we are chaining the prompts rather than finding the reason in one go.

### <center>Chaining Prompt , but why ?  </center>
+ More focused 
	+ breaks down a complex system
+ Context Limitations 
	+ Max tokens for input prompt and output response
+ Reduced Costs
	+ pay per token
